 This class will handle most of location list logic. We try to keep the view controller dumb. When business logic grows, we would like business logic to be here because business logic changes less frequently than UI. Leave UI dumb and easy to be replaced.
 One of the thing can be added here is pagination logic, sorting based on user location, etc.
